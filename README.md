# ambient-light-sensing

Prototype iOS application to use the iPhone sensers/camera to determine ambient light.

## Notes

- It looks like ARKit ambient light APIs doesn't give enough resolution on the higher endâ€“meaning that a well-lit room will register the same as being outside on a sunny day.
- Need to look into using the camera APIs instead.
